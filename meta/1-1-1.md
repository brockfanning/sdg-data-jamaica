  This indicator combines the poverty indicator under the first target (1a) of
  the MDGs on the eradication of poverty with the corresponding working
  indicator for monitoring the second target (1b) of the MDGs on decent work. By
  combining poverty status with employment status, the concept of the working
  poor is captured, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in
  employment, live in poverty.
